# Dice!

Here you can find a dice game which is my first own project in JavaScript. The whole JS code was created in the Object-Oriented Programming paradigm. 

# Main information about the game

## Language

**Game is available only in Polish**

## Start
If you wanna start the game, just choose the number of the players and name them! 
You can play against "Computer" (if you choose only one player) or against your friend (if you choose two players).

## Rules
If you wanna know the rules, you can click "Zasady" button in the right top corner of the main board screen. After that, you will see a window that contains the whole rules of the game.

# Important! 

If you want to play that game, you must have a browser that supports ES6 (ECMAScript 6)!

# Technologies I used 

- HTML5 with BEM methodology
- SCSS
- JavaScript
